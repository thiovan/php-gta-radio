2|K-DST Radio|k-dst.png|k-dst.mp3|K-DST has the identity of a classic rock station that has been airing its music "sucessfuly for 22 years" according to one of the radio stingers, suggesting it was first broadcast in 1970. As such, there are somewhat nostalgic comments in the radio stingers, such as "music never gets old, just a little *cough* dusty" and mentions to "buddies from the \'70s [who have] gone to rehab". The stingers also mock the current music trends of the time, such as grunge and gangsta rap.;
